# Loan-Approval-Prediction
Machine learning project to predict loan approval using demographic, financial, and credit data.

# Loan Approval Prediction

## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting whether a loan application will be **approved** or **rejected** using machine learning techniques. By learning patterns from historical loan data, the model can help automate and speed up the loan decision process.

## Dataset Information
The dataset includes different details of loan applicants, such as:

- Age  
- Education  
- Employment type  
- Monthly income  
- Loan amount  
- Loan term  
- Credit score  

**Target Column:** Loan Status (Approved / Rejected)

## Project Steps
- Data loading  
- Checking and handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical data  
- Basic data analysis  
- Training machine learning models  
- Evaluating model performance  

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  

The models were trained and compared to determine which one performed the best.

## Output
The final model predicts whether a new loan application will be:

- **Approved**  
or  
- **Rejected**

based on the input features.

## Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Conclusion
This project shows how machine learning can help automate loan approval decisions. Instead of reviewing each application manually, a trained model can provide quicker and more consistent results using data.
