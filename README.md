# Loan-Approval-Prediction
Machine learning project to predict loan approval using demographic, financial, and credit data.

Introduction

This is a machine learning project to predict whether a person will get a loan or not. We are using past loan applicant data and training a model on it. After training, the model can give output as Approved or Rejected based on the given details.

About the Dataset

The dataset contains different information about people who applied for loans, like:

Age

Education

Job type

Income

Loan amount

Credit score

Loan term

The last column tells whether the loan was approved earlier or not.

What We Did

Loaded the dataset

Checked missing values and cleaned the data

Converted categorical data into numerical format

Did some basic analysis to understand which factors affect loan approval

Trained different machine learning models

Compared their accuracy and selected the best model

Models Used

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Result

The model predicts if a new person’s loan application should be approved or rejected based on the data provided.

Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-Learn

Conclusion

This project helps in making the loan approval process faster and more reliable. Instead of checking files manually, a computer can give results automatically by looking at the data.
